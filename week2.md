Week 2 is here, but where is the offense? Maybe we can say Mahomes three times in a row? The themes for the matchups are all based on Tim Burton movies.

Scores are way down, and we see that in our matchup of the week. Both were expected to score big, over 180 points a piece, but EverybodyKurts and his team Burrow'd Time ended up winning 128 to 110.

prompt:

```
Create an image of a recently deceased ghost Tee Nick who is about to get eaten by a sandworm. Kurt is riding the sandworm.
Tee Nick is a ghost that looks like a like he died from a baseball lodged in the side of his temple. Kurt looks like a guy who died riding a bicyle. Give him a spandex bicyclist outfit and a helment that is bloody and has a piece of iron sticking out of it. Do the image in the style of Beetlejuice ghosts.

## Dirty Birds vs Team BeeWags

In another close matcher, the OG Dirty Bird The Penguin topples BeeWag 172 to 159. BeeWag got the manager of the week for setting a perfect line-up, so I guess he has got that going for him. Dirty Bird remains undefeated.

prompt:
```
a danny devito inspired Penguin villian from Batman laughs as a centaur falls in an icy pit. Birds are flying around. Penguins are flapping. The centaur is kicking.
```

Chubby time remaines undefeated in a low-scoring affair, beating All in the That 5 Hole 114 to 92.

prompt:
```
Pee-Wee Herman and the entire fun house celebrates when the phrase of the day "chubby time" is announced. A personified chair is celebrating. A mailbox personified is celebrating. A mailman is celebrating. A large tv personified is celebrating. The 5th hole, a hole in the wall that is labeled "5th hole" is not celebrating. create an image.
