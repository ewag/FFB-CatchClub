## Max vs Mahomes for the Holidays

You know, sometimes you go to the waiver wire, you're there first, and you pick up a wideout who scores 3 TDs, goes for 175 yards, scoring 51 points. Then someone swoops in, and grabs the win! You say, "But that's not the point, I was here first, I should get the win!"

But if you got the win, you would have won

**You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way!**


prompt:
```
draw in a cartoony way. a heavyset balding new yorker is standing in the middle of a chinese restaurant.  He is wearing kahki pants, and a checked shirt, and glasses. A dialogue bubble says "We're living in a society! " He is very angry and the angle of the shot is low, and it looks like he is powering up like a dragon ball z hero.

## Tee Nick vs My Ball Zach Ertz

It was intense! Probably going to be the closet game in our league we see this season. Tee Nick beat My Ball Zach Ertz (Best Team Name!) by less than a point! 117.15 - 116.75

0.4 Difference! 

MBZE was right there at the end, but broke out their Scent of a Woman impression at the wrong moment, and NO SOUP FOR YOU!

**NEXT!**

prompt:
```
An Armenian man, who is clean cut, wearing kitchen whites, has dark features and a mustache behind a soup counter with a raised ladle. He is  yelling with a dialogue box angerily, " NO SOUP FOR YOU!". The yelling is directed at a bashful and sad large football player on the other side of the counter. The football player is wearing a red and yellow themed uniform and wears number 86. There is also a postal worker featured who is very happy and excited with his soup order. His dialogue bubble says "jambalaya". His is a very large postal worker with small hands.

## Dirty Birds vs Team BeeWags

In another close matcher, the OG Dirty Bird The Penguin topples BeeWag 172 to 159. BeeWag got the manager of the week for setting a perfect line-up, so I guess he has got that going for him. Dirty Bird remains undefeated.

prompt:
```
a danny devito inspired Penguin villian from Batman laughs as a centaur falls in an icy pit. Birds are flying around. Penguins are flapping. The centaur is kicking.
```

Chubby time remaines undefeated in a low-scoring affair, beating All in the That 5 Hole 114 to 92.

```

A mailman is celebrating. A large tv personified is celebrating. The 5th hole, a hole in the wall that is labeled "5th hole" is not celebrating. create an image.
