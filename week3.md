## Max vs Mahomes for the Holidays

You know, sometimes you go to the waiver wire, you're there first, and you pick up a wideout who scores 3 TDs, goes for 175 yards, scoring 51 points. Then someone swoops in, and grabs the win! You say, "But that's not the point, I was here first, I should get the win!"

But if you got the win, you would have won

**You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way!**

prompt:

> draw in a cartoony way. a heavyset balding new yorker is standing in the middle of a chinese restaurant.  He is wearing kahki pants, and a checked shirt, and glasses. A dialogue bubble says "We're living in a society! " He is very angry and the angle of the shot is low, and it looks like he is powering up like a dragon ball z hero.
